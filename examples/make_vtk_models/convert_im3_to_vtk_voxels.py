This script imports a synthetic, binarized image stack. The resultant
image stack can be thought of a voxel model (i.e., 3D pixels). The 
result is visualized to the user and optionally saved to the hard 
drive.

# vapi.make_vtk_unstruct_grid() depends on a Cython extension that was compiled

#  -------- VISUALIZE VTK MODEL --------

# For large models, may want to set show_edges=False since the black lines can
# be so close to each that the whole model ends up being black. With a black
# background, this can cause the illusion that the model is hidden.
