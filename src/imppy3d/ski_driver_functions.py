    continuous ridges, e.g. tubes, wrinkles, rivers. This type of
    filter is also referred to as a ridge operator. This is the
    non-interactive version of interact_driver_ridge_filter().

    ---- INPUT ARGUMENTS ----
    [img_in]: Numpy array for a grayscale image. It is assumed that the
        image is already grayscale and of type uint8. The array should
        thus be 2D, where each value represents the intensity for each
        corresponding pixel.
    
    fltr_params_in: A list of parameters needed to perform the 
        ridge filter. The first parameter is a string, which
        determines what type of ridge filter to be applied, as well
        as the definitions of the remaining parameters. As of now,
        fltr_params_in[0] must be "sato_tubeness". 
        Example parameter lists are given below for each type, 
            
            ["sato_tubeness", mask_val_out, sig_max_out, blk_ridges_out]

                mask_val_out: Only values greater than mask_val_out will
                    be altered by this filter. Hence, this integer acts
                    as a basic mask.

                sig_max_out: The maximum sigma used to scale  the 
                    filter. A range of sigma values will automatically
                    creates from one to sig_max_out in steps of one,
                    which is then utilized by the Sato filter. See the
                    Skimage documentation for more details. Typically
                    a value of ten is appropriate.

                blk_ridges_out: A boolean that affects whether the 
                    filter should detect black ridges or white ridges.
                    When True, the filter detects black ridges.
            
    quiet_in: A boolean that determines if this function should print
        any statements to standard output. If False (default), outputs  
        are written. Conversely, if True, outputs are suppressed. This
        is particularly useful in the event of batch processing.
