    No additional smoothing or modification to the resultant mesh is 
    performed. If this is desired, then consider making a VTK surface
    mesh and using Laplacian smoothing, which is all available with 
    little effort in make_vtk_surf_mesh() defined below. To measure
    the surface area, use skimage.measure.mesh_surface_area(). Or, 
    create a VTK surface mesh using make_vtk_surf_mesh() and then
    retrieve the pyvista.PolyData.area property.

    ---- INPUT ARGUMENTS ---- 
    [[[img_arr_in]]]: A 3D Numpy array representing the image sequence
        It is important that this is a Numpy array and not a Python list
        of Numpy matrices. The shape of img_arr_in is expected to be as
        (num_images, num_pixel_rows, num_pixel_cols). Note, when
        converting this to spatial coordinates, num_images is the
        Z-component, num_pixel_rows is the Y-component, and
        num_pixel_cols is the X-component. It is expected that the
        images are single-channel, and the data should be of type uint8.
        Specifically, intensities should range from 0 to 255. If it is
        segmented (i.e., binarized), then only values of 0 and 255 
        should be present (NOT 0 and 1).

    iso_level: A scalar number used to define the value for the iso-
        surface. For a binarized image sequence, a value in between 
        0 and 255, like 125, is recommended. For grayscale image
        sequence, any value can be used, and the corresponding 
        isosurface will be approximated.

    scale_spacing: A scalar float that represents the distance between
        the voxels before they are converted to a surface. If this is
        an X-ray CT image sequence, this represents the voxel size.

    is_binary: Set to True if the image sequence is binarized. That is,
        if it contains only values of 0 and 255. Using the binaraized
        image sequence directly into the marching cubes algorithm will
        result in a very poor isosurface. So, if is_binary is True, 
        then a small amount of Gaussian blurring is performed which makes 
        for a much smoother gradient between black and white. This
        vastly improves the accuracy of the marching cubes algorithm.

    g_sigdev: A single float that corresponds to the standard deviation
        used as input for the 3D Gaussian blur that must be applied for
        a binary image sequence. If is_binary is False, this value is
        ignored. The same standard deviation will be used for all three
        axes. Typical values range between 0.5 and 1.5. This blur helps
        to stabilize the marching cubes algorithm, but it also has the
        side effect of smoothing edges by a small amount.

    pad_boundary: Set to True to extend the boundaries of the image
        sequence in all three dimensions. More specifically, in all
        six directions of the rectangular volume defined by the image
        sequence. The six boundaries will be extended by some amount. 
        The motivation to do this is to ensure
        there are no white pixels along the boundaries of the image
        sequence. Otherwise, the resultant surface will not be a 
        closed at the boundaries. If there are no white pixels along the
        boundaries to begin with, then there is no need for padding.

        will provide the [X, Y, Z] coordinates of that vertex. There
        will be V unique mesh vertices. So, the size is (V, 3).

    [[faces]]: A 2D array that defines the connectivity of the

    """
    This function converts an image sequence into an unstructured VTK
    voxel model. This function depends on a C-extension binary that
    was created using Cython. This function is the super fast version
    of make_vtk_unstruct_grid_slow(), and in general, is preferred.
    However, the binary file, called im3_processing.cp37-win_amd64.pyd
    was compiled for Python 3.7 for Windows x64. If you are using a 
    different operating system or version of Python, then the .pyx
    file will need to be re-compiled for a new target. Contact Newell
    Moser for assistance if this is the case. Otherwise, you will need
    to re-compile it or use make_vtk_unstruct_grid_slow(). By default,
    this function will only convert pixels with intensity values greater
    than or equal to one -- black pixels are skipped. However, if RAM
    is not an issue, then set all_voxels equal to True to convert all
    of the pixels. Use PyVista UniformGrid plot() function to 
    visualize the uniform grid model in 3D. To save it to a VTK file,
    use the PyVista save() function. Note, the intensity values will
    be saved in the uniform grid under the name "values".

     ---- INPUT ARGUMENTS ---- 
    [[[img_arr_in]]]: A 3D Numpy array representing the image sequence
        It is important that this is a Numpy array and not a Python list
        of Numpy matrices. The shape of img_arr_in is expected to be as
        (num_images, num_pixel_rows, num_pixel_cols). Note, when
        converting this to spatial coordinates, num_images is the
        Z-component, num_pixel_rows is the Y-component, and
        num_pixel_cols is the X-component. It is expected that the
        images are single-channel, and the data should be of type uint8.
        Specifically, intensities should range from 0 to 255. If it is
        segmented (i.e., binarized), then only values of 0 and 255 
        should be present (NOT 0 and 1).

    scale_spacing: A scalar float that represents the distance between
        the voxels before they are converted to a surface. If this is
        an X-ray CT image sequence, this represents the voxel size.

    all_voxels: By default, this is set to False, which means only non-
        black pixels will be converted to voxels. Specifically, pixels
        with intensites greater than or equal to one. Consequently, 
        this function will return a pyvista.UnstructuredGrid object. Set
        this to True in order to return all of the pixels as voxels, 
        in which case, a pyvista.StructuredGrid object is returned.

    quiet_in: An optional boolean that is by default set to False. Set 
        to True to prevent outputting any messages. 

    ---- RETURNED ----
    unstruct_grid: If all_voxels is False, a pyvista.UnstructuredGrid 
        object is returned. PyVista is a Python library that acts as a
        high-level wrapper for VTK - the visualization toolkit. 
        PyVista's UnstructuredGrid object is an extension of VTK's 
        vtkUnstructuredGrid class. If If all_voxels is True, then a 
        pyvista.StructuredGrid object is returned. PyVista's 
        StructuredGrid object is an extension of VTK's 
        vtk.vtkStructuredGrid object. For more information, see 
        https://docs.pyvista.org/core/point-grids.html

    ---- SIDE EFFECTS ----
    Function input arguments should not be altered. However, a new view
    is created for img_arr_in, not a deep copy. So, this cannot be 
    guaranteed. Nothing is written to the hard drive.
